# Secure-Password-Generator
This application will generate secure password for users that contain a mix of characters and meet password length requirements. 


The project idea that I came up with is a secure password generator. The idea comes from my interest in information security. I always found the concept of websites requiring a user to enter a password with special requirements interesting. The other aspect that I find interesting with this is the website updating dynamically to show the requirements being completed. The example that comes to mind right away is check marks being applied after the password condition is met.

I understand that strong passwords are necessary for applications and the passwords usually require a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters.

With my project, I will seek to create a password generator that creates a password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. If I can add fields for user input in a cohesive manner, I will do so within the code. 

The application can be used by any user that needs to create a secure password. Different websites and apps have different password requirements. However, some things remain the same. Things like a minimum password length, the use of uppercase letters, and special characters. 

1 - I believe that I can do this project solo.
